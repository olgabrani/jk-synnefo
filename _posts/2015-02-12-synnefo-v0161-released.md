Hello Synnefo users,

The 0.16.1 version of Synnefo has just been released. This release is targeted
towards stability and as such, we have various bug-fixes. The main changes are
the following:

* Improved handling of projects (both API- and UI-wise).
* Updates and fixes for snf-deploy.
* Various bug fixes and improvements across Synnefo.

You can find a [complete changelog][1] in our docs page as well as upgrade
notes from the [previous release][2].

As always, feedback through our [mailing list][3] or [IRC channel][4] is highly
appreciated.

Enjoy,  
the Synnefo team
