Hello Synnefo users,

we are happy to announce that Synnefo v0.19 is out!

As you may already know from a previous email on the list: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/synnefo/E7172AT6l9Y](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/synnefo/E7172AT6l9Y)

Synnefo v0.19 brings an upgrade to Debian Jessie.

Apart from the platform upgrade, the most notable changes are:

* Enhancements in VM allocation policy
* Support for the keypairs API for ssh key management
* Improved OpenStack compatibility
* Improved IP usage history

This version also includes smaller bug fixes and enhancements. Please see the [Changelog](https://www.synnefo.org/docs/synnefo/latest/Changelog.html) file for the complete list.

Upgrading to v0.19 is definitely recommended. Keep in mind that upgrading to Synnefo v0.19 also requires upgrading your base system from wheezy to jessie. Please see the corresponding upgrade notes [here](https://www.synnefo.org/docs/synnefo/latest/admin-guide.html#upgrade-notes).

So, try it out and report back! As always, feedback is highly appreciated.

Enjoy,<br>
the Synnefo team
